Genomic Data Processing Workflow
This Nextflow workflow is designed to perform the initial steps in genomic data processing, including the conversion of BCL (Base Call) files to FASTQ format, alignment of reads to a reference genome sequence, and variant calling. The workflow utilizes various bioinformatics tools for each step.

Workflow Steps:
Step 1: Conversion of BCL to FASTQ
Tool Used: [bcl2fastq](https://
support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/bcl2fastq-conversion-software.html)
This step converts raw BCL files located in the specified bcl directory to the standard FASTQ format, which is commonly used for storing raw sequencing data.

Step 2: Alignment to Reference Genome
Tool Used: Bowtie2

This step aligns the converted FASTQ reads to a reference genome sequence, enabling the identification of the genomic locations of the sequenced fragments.


Step 3: Variant Calling
Tool Used: GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit)
This step performs variant calling on the aligned reads to identify genomic variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels).


Usage:
Install Nextflow: Follow the instructions on the Nextflow website to install Nextflow.

Create a configuration file (e.g., nextflow.config) specifying the paths to the required tools and reference genome.

Run the workflow:

nextflow run genomic_workflow.nf -profile <profile_name>
Replace <profile_name> with the desired execution profile (e.g., local, slurm, awsbatch).

Note:
Customize the paths and parameters in the commands based on your specific directory structure and reference genome.
